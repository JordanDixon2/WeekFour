- Downloaded data for excel work, saved it to folder called "craftingdigh".
- Copied and pasted the url into voyant tools.
- Copying the link and pasting it into voyant tools did not work, so I had to download the link and upload it.
- Here is the note for my corpus ID: ea3ac9f0c7fa27331793c83984ce3b7f. Here is the url: https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=ea3ac9f0c7fa27331793c83984ce3b7f
- Clicking on the Terms table, and then clicking on words in there gives me a line graph of how much they are used throughout each part of the text.
- I found it pretty cool, clicking on a part in the line graph and it showing me the last five words and the next five words surrounding the one word I was focused on.
- I can not only look through that, but I can click on "phrases" to look at a list of every way my term was worded in a sentence, almost like my 'f3" word search ability on windows.
- I am not sure how else to add this url to github seeing as it is not a file, I will paste it here for now until I learn what is wrong:<iframe style='width: 305px; height: 475px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/tool/CorpusTerms/?corpus=ea3ac9f0c7fa27331793c83984ce3b7f'></iframe>
- Getting an error message when clicking the link, But I am probably not putting the link in the correct position, I will hold onto this url and move on for now.
- Downloaded Antconc immediately, was literally one step of clicking on the download button through the links provided by Dr. Graham.
- Antconc is really easy to use, it is a lot like voyant tools I just worked with. 
- I pasted some articles into antconc, search for words, and it gave me every time that word comes up in every article I pasted, as well as the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th words that come up after it. I can also play with the options to show graphs similar to those on voyant, as well as get numbers on how many times a word or word combo shows up in each and every text file.
- Moving on to topic models, I tried downloading the topicmodelingtool.zip for windows, and I cannot extract the files from the zipped folder because my computer says the folder I am downloading is empty. This is very strange and I have no idea how to fix this so I will wait for Dr. Graham for help on this one as well.
- FOR DR. GRAHAM, this is the html snippet for voyant: <iframe style='width: 305px; height: 475px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/tool/CorpusTerms/?corpus=ea3ac9f0c7fa27331793c83984ce3b7f'></iframe>
